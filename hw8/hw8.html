<h1>Homework 8: Ratio Maps -- Paloma Baca </h1>
<h2>Paloma Baca</h2>
<p>I decided to create a ratio of women who have not given birth compared to those who have (measuring total women who did not give birth / total women who did give birth) The lighter areas in the map represent the areas that have the highest amount of women who are giving birth, and the darker areas are places where the number of women not giving birth far outnumbers the amount of women giving birth. Essentially, this is a rudimentary way to measure in-community population growth, and when combined with education data, access to education, healthcare, and adequate family planning services.</p>
