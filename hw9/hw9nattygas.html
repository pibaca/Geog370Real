<h1>Homework 9: Make a choropleth or proportional symbol map </h1>
<h2>Paloma Baca</h2>
<h3>For this homework, I did a choropleth that represented the average cost for the natural gas consumption per square mile in the continental United States. Generally, areas with more people had a higher cost of natural gas per square mile most likely because of the increased demand for natural gas. It's important to note that the Texas infornmation did not transfer over, due to shapefile issues. I decided to choose cost per square mile in natural gas consumption because eventually I would like to go into renewable energy accessibility, especially in high population and/or urban areas. In thi smap, we can see that urbanized areas such as Florida, California, and New York City have some of the highest costs for natural gas. On the other end of the spectrum, New England and most of the southeast have extremely high costs, possibly because of lack of access to natural gas pipes or different energy sources being available for a cheaper price.  </h3>
