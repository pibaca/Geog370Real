<h1>Homework 10: Future Land Use and Brownfields</h1>
<h2>Paloma Baca</h2>
<h3>Brownfields are sites designated as any previously developed land that is not currently in use that may be potentially contaminated. These sites were created with the Superfund Act of 1979. The term is also used to describe industrial land that has known pollution or soil contamination. Due to the hazardous nature of these sites, as well as the physically intense and financially costly cleanup required, oftentimes these sites are left untouched and undeveloped.
<p></p>
Although left undeveloped, these sites can still cause harm. Thus, for this project I found Brownfields in the Seattle Area and created a buffer of a few blocks around each one. Then I dissolved the buffers in order to get a clearer picture of how big the area was without overlap. Additionally, I was able to find data about future planning until 2035, and find where these Brownfields intersect with residential areas. For the most part, it is Single Family Residential Areas that have the highest amount of intersection, as well as Residential Urban Villages.
