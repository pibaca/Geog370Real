<h1>Homework 7: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>Paloma Baca</h2>
<h3>This is a map of the distribution of births by county in Washington. Instead of using this as a function of population, the data had parameters about education and its correlation with birth rates per county. In 2019 the more populated areas generally have higher births per year, whereas the more rural areas had less. Additionally, the data was sorted into quantiles instead of a natural break sorting style.  </h3>
